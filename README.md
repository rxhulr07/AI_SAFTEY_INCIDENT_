## ðŸ§  Design Decisions & Challenges

While building the project, one of the biggest challenges I faced was designing the UI, as I am not a professional UI/UX designer. 
I struggled with deciding how the interface should look and made numerous changes along the way. At times, I even ended up deleting and restarting the entire project two or three times. This experience taught me the importance of having at least a basic blueprint or wireframe beforehand, as it would have made the development process much smoother and more efficient. Despite the challenges, it was a valuable learning experience that helped me improve my design and problem-solving skills.
